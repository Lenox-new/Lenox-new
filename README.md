## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I have a higher education. I graduated from the Ryazan Radio Engineering Institute in the Department of Radio Engineering.
## As for my work experience, I can mention my work on an AI-related project. I worked on this project for 1.5 years, and my main task was to generate data for AI.
## I can say that I can adapt to various tasks in projects when necessary, and I will be very punctual when working with a specific deadline.
